            <h3>How to use the MBPM Service Issue Tracker</h3>
            <p>
                Your place of residence is your castle, your sanctuary, your place of peace and happiness, the place you look 
                forward to going back to at the end of a long day of work. Unfortunately, as we all know, things can break and 
                unforseen events can happen that disrupt that peace and happiness and can make your residence not feel so much
                like a sanctuary.
            </p>
            <p>
                MBPM is here to ensure that whatever goes wrong gets resolved as quickly as possible, reinstating your sanctuary 
                as little disruption as possible. To help us do that, we have created this web site that allows you to report an 
                issue with us. You can track its resolution progress and utimately what the resolution whas. We have worked really 
                hard at MBPM to make the service issue tracker (SIT) as intuitive as possible. However, if you need a little more 
                guidance, please read on.
            </p>

                There has been no successful software product that has had only a version 1! Our best marketing is you, our customer.
                To that end, on the main Unicorn Accelerator dashboard page you have the ability to request new features.

                                        If you have run into an issue with Unicorn Accelerator and are logged in, you may enter a new 
                                        issue by clicking on the "Report Issue" button on the "UA Issues" tab on the dashboard on the main
                                        page of our site. Note: that button remains disabled until you are logged in.

                                        Issues have 3 statuses:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Reported</li>

                                        When you first create an issue, it has a status of "Reported". Once someone at UA has
                                        seen the issue and acknowledged it, it then is promoted to "Ongoing" meaning we are working 
                                        on it. And finally, once we have fixed the issue, the status gets promoted to "Closed".

                                        <strong>Requested</strong> is the status of the request when you first make the feature request. 
                                        When you request a feature you give it a title and then a detailed description. If we have more 
                                        questions about the feature, we will contact you via email and possibly set up a meeting if needed.
                                    </p>

                                        What is key about requesting a feature is the bidding process. Every feature that is requested must 
                                        have a bid (in GBP) associated with it. This bid is entered at time of entering the details about 
                                        the feature. The bid can be between &#163;10.00 and &#163;5000.00. In most cases UA will prioritise
                                        feature requests based on amount bid. Therefore, the higher the bid, the more likely it will get accepted.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once we have accepted the feature, the feature status will be listed in the dashboard as 
                                        <strong>Accepted</strong> <span class="accepted-feature waiting-payment">with this</span>&nbsp;
                                        icon next to it.</span> At this point, you can click on that icon where it will take you to a page 
                                        to enter your credit card details.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once the payment has been processed successfully, the status of the request will show as 
                                        <strong>Accepted</strong> <span class="accepted-feature working">with this</span> &nbsp;icon next to it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once the feature has been completed it will be promoted to a status of <strong>Finished</strong> and 
                                        automatically pushed out. We will notify you via email upon completion.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Requests will be <strong>Denied</strong> if the bids are too low and/or we have a many other requests at
                                        much higher bids.
                                    </p>
